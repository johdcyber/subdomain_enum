# subdomain_enum
This Python script enumerates subdomains of a given domain. The script uses a list of subdomains from the file subdomains.txt and tries to connect to each subdomain using the HTTP protocol. If the connection is successful, the script writes the subdomain to a text file called succes.domain.txt.
